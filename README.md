## To run on your local machine:

### Set up the database:
1. Install PostgreSQL.
2. create a new database.
```
CREATE DATABASE bank;
```
3. create new tables in that database.
```
CREATE TABLE customers(
    c_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    balance FLOAT
);

CREATE TABLE transfers(
    t_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    sender VARCHAR(255),
    receiver VARCHAR(255),
    transfer_amount FLOAT
);
```

4. Add mock data to the customers table.
5. create a .env file in the source folder of the project with the following enviornment variables.
```
PG_USER = postgres
PG_PASSWORD = <password of the postgres user>
PG_HOST = localhost
PG_PORT = 5432
PG_DATABASE = bank
```
6. run `npm install` in the root folder as well as the frontend folder.
7. run `node index` in the root folder to start the backend on `http://localhost:5000`.
8. run `npm start` in the frontend folder to start the react frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.
